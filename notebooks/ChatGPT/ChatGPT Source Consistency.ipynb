    "<p>This boxplot shows how the Mean Internal Source Overlap (MISO) changes with increasing query specificity: General (G), General + Price (G + P), General + Price + Feature (G + P + F), and General + Price + Feature + Feature (G + P + F + F). Each additional constraint tests ChatGPT’s ability to maintain consistency in the sources it cites as queries become more detailed and restrictive.</p> \n",

    "<ul> \n",
    "    <li>Highest median MISO with minimal variance, indicating strong stability in cited sources.</li> \n",
    "    <li>Open-ended prompts yield consistent retrieval patterns as ChatGPT repeatedly draws from a similar set of broad, authoritative references.</li> </ul> \n",
    "<h5>G + P (General + Price)</h5> \n",
    "<ul> \n",
    "    <li>Moderate median MISO with slightly increased spread.</li> \n",
    "    <li>Introducing a price constraint adds a filtering layer, slightly diversifying the sources referenced across runs.</li> \n",
    "</ul> \n",
    "<h5>G + P + F (General + Price + Feature)</h5> \n",
    "<ul> \n",
    "    <li>Lower median MISO and larger variability.</li> \n",
    "    <li>Feature-level filtering narrows the relevant source pool, increasing the model’s sensitivity to query nuance and context shifts.</li> \n",

    "<ul> \n",
    "    <li>Lowest median MISO and widest spread, reflecting high variability in source citation.</li> \n",
    "    <li>As constraints multiply, retrieval becomes more context-specific and less repetitive, leading to reduced source overlap across runs.</li> </ul> \n",
    "<p>Overall, MISO decreases as query complexity increases. ChatGPT exhibits consistent citation behavior for general queries but becomes more adaptive and exploratory when handling detailed, multi-constraint requests. This trend suggests a shift from stable retrieval toward more context-sensitive and dynamic sourcing as query specificity rises.</p>"
