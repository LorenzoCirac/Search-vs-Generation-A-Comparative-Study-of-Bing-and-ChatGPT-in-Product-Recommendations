    "<p>This boxplot shows how the Mean Internal Product Overlap (MIPO) changes as query complexity increases. Each query type progressively adds more constraints: General (G), General + Price (G + P), General + Price + Feature (G + P + F), and General + Price + Feature + Feature (G + P + F + F).</p> <h5>G (General)</h5> \n",
